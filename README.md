# My Canva

This is a TODO board application similar to <b>Trello</b>, where users can create different boards for themselves. Boards can be private, requiring a password for editing. All boards and changes are stored locally on the computer.

Create a new board and load it. You can then freely add new tasks to the board. Tasks can be moved and removed, as well as repositioned.

Use the "Save" button to store changes, and the "Revert" button to return to the original state.
